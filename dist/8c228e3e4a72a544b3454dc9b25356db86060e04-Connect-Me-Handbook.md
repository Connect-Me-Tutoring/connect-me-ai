OUR
IMPACT:
```
```
“We like to consider ourselves role models for the students we're helping. We don't
want to be just some random person on a computer screen to them.”
```
- FOUNDER (MEHMET TASCIOGLU)

```
As the largest student-run tutoring
nonprofit organization in the United
States, we provide free tutoring to K-
students who come from low-income
families, have essential worker parents,
or are attending/have attended virtual
school due to COVID-19.
```
#### WHO WE ARE

```
As a Connect Me tutor, you will
tutor a student (or multiple, if
you want!) weekly through our
Tutor Portal. Once you match
with a student, you’ll see your
information on the Tutor Portal.

###### Here’s what you should do:

## The 4-Step Protocol

###### SEASON 6

```
After calling, send a text message
Wait ~10 minutes before leaving the Zoom
If they respond and can join, stay and tutor for the remainder of the
session (you may extend to an hour for extra volunteer hours).
If the student never showed up after 15 minutes , leave the Zoom and
fill out the SEF.
```
#### STEP 2: TEXT MESSAGE

```
If there’s no response after a day, email the parent asking if
the student will attend next session.
If rescheduling is needed, use the Portal’s reschedule feature
```
#### STEP 3: EMAIL

```
If there’s no reply after a couple days, send a DM to our
Internal Vice President, Yulianna Kowalczyk, for further
assistance.
